        <h2>#1: Aesthetics of the Internet</h2>
            <p>
      I think it is very interesting how the article compares information on the internet with information on public media. Information on public media is more of a static content that is produced for everyone with the same point of view. However, information on internet is a live context that people give birth to and interact with each other. Internet allows people to access what they are looking for directly. Just like how people used to go through the archives, look for the authors, look for the library cards, and then find a book, internet sort out the information for us, put chaos in orders, and allow us to access what we are looking for directly. Internet becomes a whole new environment that our knowledge and identity grow in.

        <h2>#2: The World Wide Web</h2>
            <p>
To be honest, I still don’t really understand what each model of web is and the differences between those models. However, it is true that every website follow a certain structure. Just like architecture, different floor plans and designs are used based on the purpose of the building. Schools will have lots of rooms, museums will have lots of open spaces, and churches will have stained glasses. Blogs will have lots of words, online portfolios will have lots of images, and online libraries will have lots of links to other resources. Different model of web serves different function, but all websites share common features, the interconnection between data and the common language used to construct the page. It is interesting to see that information can be translated according to the information in the address. It is just like different types of interface are able to communicate within themselves in the digital space.

        <h2>#3: UX</h2>
            <p>
I learned that both design and programming is very important. The designer is responsible for the end user’s respond to the website. When designing the website, a detailed design strategy to follow is necessary. It is important to keep the usability of the interface in mind because it is the first step that will lead users to other functions and layers of the website. Usability can be accomplished through consistency, information feedback, and shortcuts. A website should have clear content, appealing visuals, physical objects user encounter the website through, some kind of measurement of time, and interactivity or immersive experience. When it comes to interactivity, it is also important to understand how humans think and what humans expect from something similar to their past experiences, not only for the purpose of engaging users but also for the purpose of guiding users through the interface and battling users’ short term memory in the process. After all of these are planned, it is important to have wireframes of the website to follow. From personal experience, wireframes are very useful in helping the designer establish the order of things to code and organizing the codes, because it is easy to get everything mixed up since many elements of the website are connected with each other or will influence each other. On top of all these, it is also important to stay updated about the technology because this industry is constantly evolving. Although designing an interface is as complicated as it sounded above, it is important to keep the final result that user will see at the end simple, which is probably the hardest part. Focusing on a certain group of audience also plays a big role in determine how the interface should be designed. As for Jakob Neilson’s article How Users Read The Web,” I think it is really funny how he started off the title by the answer “They don’t.” I think it is very true, and that is why we need to keep things simple but meaningful and at the same time use graphics or sound to catch user’s attention.

        <h2>#4: Internet as Art</h2>
            <p>
I think it is interesting how Goran Mijuk challenged the definition of art by comparing gallery art and internet art. People tend to think of art as gallery art and tend to give an artwork value depending on the limited production. However, despite the supply and demand relationship that boost up gallery art’s popularity, internet art is also a form of art. It is a new form of art that is not only accessible all the time, but also retouchable, preservable, and can be spread throughout the world to various audience without the limitation of cross countries and needs of transportation. I have been practicing fine art for my entire life but I have also started to focus on digital art a lot more in the past few years. When I started getting into digital art, it was because I realized how much prettier I can make my artwork seem online through editing the photos of my artwork. I started embracing the clean and precise work machine produces and I started to find it easier to do designs on computer than with hands. Later on, I also started to enjoy the feature of internet art that allows me to go back to an artwork and make changes. There is just so much more flexibility to digital art that gallery art cannot achieve. However, I do believe that different kinds of art belong to different places. Digital art belongs to digital space and will not be successful when they are brought to museums and treated as gallery art. Likewise, traditional paintings and drawings that have a lot of details and specific use of materials should not be treated as internet art because some quality of the artwork may be lost when it is transferred to a 2D image.
