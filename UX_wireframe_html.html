        This design and fonts will be kept throughout every page of my website to maintain a consistency that allows the user to learn faster about how to use the website and what to expect. Something that will be different to keep the audience interested in the website while at the same time maintain the consistency is that the colors of each page will be different. The colors will be the major element that reflect the disnger's taste and catch the user's eyes. On the top right corner will be a Home button with a symbol of a house that people can easily associate with "home" or "home page." Each link on each page will be directly leaded to the project or assignment. If it is am addignment that requires more space of text and visual content, another page that has a consistent design with the "About Me" page will be linked. To add interactivity, different colors will be applied to hover texts.
