         This project is not focused on text, even though there will be short introduction to each breakdancer. Since dancing is all about the movements and the music, there will be a lot of visuals and sounds, mostly from videos. I will only focus on four of my favorite bboys because there are way too many of them. The audience of this website is most likely going to be people who are already interested in breakdance. Since it’s going to be “new battles” created by the user and the focus isn’t on text, it is assumed that the user already has some previous knowledge of who the breakdancers and understand how to distinguish between a good battle and a bad battle. VR will be used in this project to create the space for the battle. Breaking battles usually happen in a cypher, or within a circle. Therefore, VR will be able to provide the user a more realistic experience of being inside the battle observing the breakdancers in 360 degrees at the center of the cypher. On top of this, an important element in breakdancing is that it is important to display movements in all directions, which resemble the characteristic of VR.
