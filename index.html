            "Seahorses are unique individuals...members of this sign rarely ever talk about themselves or share their troubles, yet they are among the best at listening and giving good advice.... those born under this sign would rather slowly and steadily crawl toward their goals than risk appearing incapable or needy. Interestingly it is often their independent successes that give them the confidence to progress in life. Over time, each Seahorse will need to figure out that by accepting assistance from others, they can actually make it much farther in life...
True friends are like family to them, and family is of high importance...Seahorses are notoriously hard to get to know, but they are also caring, sensitive and devoted when they do finally make a commitment to a partnership...Seahorses are curious creatures and prefer to follow their well-tuned instincts when searching for their passion in life. While those born under this sign are tough and imaginative enough to succeed in the corporate world, they will most likely find that the most enjoyable careers are the ones that take their unique interests and skills into consideration."             - Primal Astrology
