    <h1>Reading Response</h1>
      <h2>I think it is very interesting how the article compares information on the internet with information on public media. Information on public media is more of a static content that is produced for everyone with the same point of view. However, information on internet is a live context that people give birth to and interact with each other. Internet allows people to access what they are looking for directly. Just like how people used to go through the archives, look for the authors, look for the library cards, and then find a book, internet sort out the information for us, put chaos in orders, and allow us to access what we are looking for directly. Internet becomes a whole new environment that our knowledge and identity grow in.
