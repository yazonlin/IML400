   Grew up in Germany, Storm is one of the pioneers of all-styles, including breaking, popping, and locking. Storm has been dancing since he was a little child and has mastered every style to the point where he can implement different characteristics of each style in his performances. As an expert in the studies of street dance and an experienced dancer who has been one of the judges of famous competitions, Storm doesn't only focus on showing off powermoves, but also intelligently uses top rock to display musicality and originality.
