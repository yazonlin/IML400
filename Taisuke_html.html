    Taisuke is a b-boy from Japan who is always so close to winning Red Bull BC One but has never actually winned the competition. Yet, his popularity is just as much, if not more, as any other all star b-boy. Taisuke is humble in the way that he does not always provoke his opponent with aggressive moves. However, the incomparable cleaness and overpowering energy in his movements completely block the opponent from winning. He pulls off insanely difficult power moves with high level of coolness. He is the kind of person who can be no one if he doesn't want to, but king of breakdance if he really wants to.
