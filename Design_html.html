            The project will start off from a main page with the title and several choices of battles to go to. Each battle will lead to a VR space that has videos of each breakdancer all over the place.

             The project will be consistent in the use of large amount of black with some vibrant colors here and there. These colors are used because they are usually seen at street dance battles and events. These colors are not only what people used to recognize and relate to the theme "breakdance," but also what that can bring out the energy of breakdance and give users a similar feeling of being on a stage surrounded with lights. I also added a "vote" section on the main page because I am interested in seeing how they will think differently about the breakdancers according to their choices of order of the videos that make them prefer or focus more on one particular dancer. However, I am aware that I may not have the ability to bring the "vote" function alive.
