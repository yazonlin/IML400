    Lil G is a b-boy from Caracas who started dancing since he was 11 years old. He was devoted in powermoves and is now recognized for his beautifully exaggerated movements that display high energy in complete extensions. His movements also contain aboslute cleanness and surprising speed that kept him at top 5s of reowned competitions.
