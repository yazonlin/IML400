       I go by Angela, because no one ever knows how to pronounce my name correctly. I am a student of Media Arts and Practice major with double minors, Dance in Popular Culture and Architecture. As you can see, I have extremely broad interests. I am very curious about the world and very passionate about learning. You can say that I am a part time student, part time workaholic. I enjoy pushing my own limits and stepping out of comfort zone to experience new things and gain new knowledge. This is my second coding class at USC, or in my entire life, and I am going to be honest right here, I am struggling a lot. My emphasis has always been on graphic design, photography, and fine arts. Coding is just like a foreign language to me that I would stare at it forever and never understand it. However, the codes and the internet are truly fascinating. As much as I get stressed out on it, I also wish to obtain these skills. In the future, I hope to pursue careers in the transmedia entertainment such as Alternate Reality Games, immersive theaters, immersive branding, and any other field that maximizes peopleâ€™s creativity. Therefore, if I successfully achieved the goals of this class, I would like to use these skills to build a portfolio. Now, I am going to start this journey from this website.
